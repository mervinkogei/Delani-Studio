        <p class="about">
            When you work with us, you are part of a team of committed
            collaborators. All aspects of our software development process are
            integrated, interactive and agile. <br />
            Our approach unifies design, development and product management to
            create exceptional products. <br />
            We start each project by understanding your business goals, the userâ€™s
            needs and the product requirements.
            <br />
            Then we help translate them into effective and elegant solutions.

            Before we sign a contract or write a line of code or team will spend the
            necessary time needed to understand your product vision. <br />
            The outcome of this scoping session is proposal or high-level statement
            of work. <br />
            Based on your requirements, we can provide a complete offering or just
            the pieces you need.

                <h3>DESIGN</h3>
                <p>
                    Our design practice offers a full range of services including brand
                    strategy, interaction and visual design and user experience testing.
                    Throughout your project, our designers create and implement visual
                    design and workflows, solicit user feedback and work with you to
                    make sure what gets built is what is needed.

                <h3>DEVELOPMENT</h3>
                <p>
                    All engineers are fluent in the latest enterprise, mobile and web
                    development technologies. <br />
                    They collaborate with your team to write, and improve code on a
                    daily basis, using proven practices such as test-driven development
                    and pair programming.

                <h3>PRODUCT MANAGEMENT</h3>
                <p>
                    Planning and development is iterative. Because we are constantly
                    coding and testing, the products we build are always ready to go
                    live. <br> This iterative process allows for changes as business
                    requirements involve.
